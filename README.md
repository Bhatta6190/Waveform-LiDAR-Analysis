# Waveform Lidar Data Analysis

This repository hosts tools and resources for analyzing full waveform lidar data, covering tasks such as data collection, cleaning, analysis, feature extraction, engineering, and modeling. Each directory focuses on a specific aspect of waveform lidar processing and includes all necessary resources, updated regularly as needed.

### Current Resources:
- **`Noise-addition-to-simdata`**: Tools for adding realistic noise to simulated full-waveform lidar data.
- **`Signal-deconvolution`**: Tools for correcting for the system response in full-waveform lidar data.
- **`Lidar_scan_setting.ipynb`**: Python notebook file for determining parameters required for DIRSIG based waveform lidar simulation .


Future updates will include additional modules for data processing and trait modeling.  
We welcome suggestions and contributions to improve the repository.
